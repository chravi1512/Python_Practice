##2. Control Structures
##•	Write a program to find the largest of three numbers.
a = int(input("Enter value1: "))
b = int(input("Enter value2: "))
c = int(input("Enter value3: "))
if a>b and a>c:
    print (f"{a} is greater than {b} & {c}")
elif b>a and b>c:
    print (f"{b} is greater than {a} & {c}")
else:
    print (f"{c} is greater than {a} & {b}")
##•	Write a program to accept a number from the user and check if it is prime or not.
a = int(input("Enter value: "))
if (a%1 and a%a)==0 and 
##•	Write a program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number.
##•	Write a program to find the factorial of a given number.
